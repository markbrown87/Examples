# Examples of Past Work

Welcome to my  example page which houses all my work done while at Ohio University. You will find examples of C++, C, Python, Java, OCaml,and more. If you are looking for a particular example please get in touch with me and I will link it to you otherwise please enjoy the time spent reviewing my past work.

## Getting Started

You will find that the many examples I have are sorted into languages. From there you will find labs, projects, and hobby examples but make sure to check out the dates. Anything prior to August 2017 will be in lower level classes and anything after will be upper level classes. If you want to see the progress of my work then you will find that 2400 is the beginning of my course work related to Computer Science.
