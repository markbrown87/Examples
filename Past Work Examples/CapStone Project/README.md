Project Description: 

                     The goal of the MAUT Web Application is to help someone make a decision when
                     making a purchase of something that has multiple options (i.e. car, hotel). 
                     It accomplishes this by using utility theory, which is a rational theory of 
                     making decisions. It is a theory that assumes individuals have coherent values 
                     and look forward to finding their own best options. Some limitations of MAUT
                     are that a decision maker must compare different options within the same 
                     category, each option is assumed to be described by attributes or aspects, a 
                     decision maker is further assumed to have stable preferences when comparing 
                     attribute values, and A decision maker is further assumed to have an importance 
                     ranking among attributes.
